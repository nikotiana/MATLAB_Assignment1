# MATLAB_Assignment1

Instructions:
Write a MATLAB LiveScript according to the requirements below:

Functionality
You should write code to perform the following functions:
read an image (*) into a workspace variable.
display the image.
apply an image processing filter/effect of your choice (**) to the image.
display the result.
save the resulting image to a .png file.

Formatting guidelines
The .mlx file should contain: Title, table of contents, meaningful text, and all the code required to demonstrate the functionality above structured into meaningful sections with individual headings. It might also contain images, links, references, etc.
Remarks:

(*) Using MATLAB built-in images is fine.

(**) Be creative. :-)

Bonus opportunities:

Using LiveScript controls (e.g., to select input image, filter to be applied, or file format to save the image) (up to max 30 extra points)
Hosting your code on GitHub (with proper README.md file) and/or MathWorks MATLAB Central File ExchangeLinks to an external site. (up to max 10 extra points)
(For experienced MATLAB users) Create an app with options to select input image (e.g., from a set of previously chosen MATLAB built-in images), select operation/filter/effect, visualize images before and after, and save resulting image to file. (up to max 50 extra points)
What to submit:

A single .mlx file as per the requirements above.
(OPTIONAL) A single zip file containing additional images (if relevant) and supporting files, as well as your additional LiveScripts and other files (if you attempted the bonus points).
